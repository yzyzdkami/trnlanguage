# introduction (about the web)
This is a web project about a new language is created by person.
We set up this web to store our language's grammars,words,fonts,etc.
We are going to make something interesting in our web.
So what will appear in this web?
I think we will build a article window.
In the body,we will make some small windows.
These windwos will be shown some article is written by our language.
I think these article needn't to be serious,we can write some stories can make others comfortable.
The title pages of them also should be elegant.
Moreover,I think our web can be static,we needn't to development something like the passage of contributing,the system of guest.
Then someone will ask,waht if viewers want to express their opinions or want to communiicate their ideas with other people?
There is no need to worry.
We have built a community of the language.(I will send it out at the end)
